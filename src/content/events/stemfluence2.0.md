**Stemfluence 2.0** was successfully organized by the IEEE Nepal Section in collaboration with the IEEE Student Branch, IEEE Computer Society Student Branch Chapter, and the WIE of Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University. The event aimed to spark early interest in electronics and engineering among young learners.

Students from various schools gathered at Shivapuri Secondary School in Kathmandu to take part in this engaging program. The workshop began with an interactive **“Transistor 101”** session, where Grade 9 and 10 students from three public schools in Kathmandu were introduced to transistors and their three-pin functions through simple explanations and real-world analogies. This session helped students grasp foundational electronics concepts in an approachable way.

The program continued with a **hands-on engineering design thinking workshop**. Participants used Tinkercad to simulate circuits and then translated theory into practice by building a night-light prototype using an LDR and LEDs on a breadboard. This activity effectively bridged the gap between conceptual knowledge and real hardware, strengthening practical understanding.

The event concluded with a **team-based problem-solving challenge**. Students worked in groups to design and prototype solution circuits for given scenarios. Each team presented their working models, demonstrating creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. The most effective solution was recognized and rewarded.

The success of Stemfluence 2.0 reflected the strong commitment of the IEEE Nepal Section and the dedication of its volunteers. Under the leadership of Prof. Arun Timalsina and with the support of passionate IEEE student volunteers and mentors, the program created a meaningful and inspiring learning experience for young students exploring the world of electronics.
