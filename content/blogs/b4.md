Traditional encryption methods like RSA rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Quantum computers, however, could theoretically break these in seconds.

Quantum Cryptography, specifically Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), offers a solution by using the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure secure communication that cannot be intercepted without detection.
